## 4. Manipulating objects
### 4.1 Entities: Identifiable objects that track changes and record events
- An entity needs to be identifiable. When creating it, we give it an identifier.
- Given that the state of an entity changes over time, entities are mutable objects.

### 4.2 Value objects: Replaceable, anonymous, and immutable values
Value objects are completely different:
- Much smaller (just one or two properties)
- Represent part/aspect of an entity
- Wrap one or more primitive-type values

If we want to transform it to some other value, we should just instantiate a new copy, which represents the modified value.
